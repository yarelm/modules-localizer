# modules-localizer
Using a local Go Module locally

This is an alternative to [gohack](https://github.com/rogpeppe/gohack).

I found gohack useful when I needed to modify something in a 3rd party module.
But when working locally on a module, I found it easier to just replace the module with the local dir.
